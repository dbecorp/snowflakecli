# What is Snowflakecli?

Snowflakecli is a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)-powered, AI-augmented command line interface for [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/).

It streamlines Snowflake **security**, **governance**, **operations**, and **cost optimization**.

# What does Snowflakecli do?


**Snowflakecli currently incorporates:**

* Key-Pair utilities so you can ***establish and maintain secure access to your Snowflake account***.
* Customizable security threat hunting, with the [UNC5537](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion) threat hunt being the default.
* Customizable security and auditing benchmarks, with well-known industry standards being the default.

# Q&A

#### Can I contribute?

Yes! Please!

We are readily accepting new contributions and appreciate the power of collective knowledge and experience. If you have thoughts, ideas, suggestions, or innovative use cases please create an issue and let's start the conversation. Or just pull a PR ðŸ˜€.

#### Is it secure?

Yes. The codebase is entirely open, MIT-licensed, and built with best-in-class Python tooling.

Unlike [other](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql) [tools](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowflake-cli-v2/index) from Snowflake which facilitate insecure practices such as username and password-based authentication without MFA, Snowflakecli ***explicitly mandates key-pair authentication***. 

#### Does it help my Snowflake instance be more secure?

Yes. That is why it was built.
